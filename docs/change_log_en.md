- Fix the problem of timeline misalignment. For details, see [issue 23](https://github.com/SWHL/RapidVideOCR/issues/23)

#### 👽2023-03-23 v2.1.5 update:
- Added print to screen control parameter `is_print_console`
- Adjust the position of the `out_format` parameter to when initializing the class.

#### 😀2023-03-14 v2.1.3 update:
- Fix the error when inputting the `TXtImages` directory and recognizing the overlap

#### 😜2023-03-12 v2.1.2 update:
- Fix index error in issue [#22](https://github.com/SWHL/RapidVideOCR/issues/22)

#### 🎢2023-03-11 v2.1.1 update:
- Fix the difference between single image recognition and the previous version.
- The default recognition mode is changed to single image recognition, please decide whether to use overlapping image recognition.

#### 🥇2023-03-10 v2.1.0 update:
- Added overlap recognition function, faster speed, the default is concat recognition mode.

#### 🎈2023-03-02 v2.0.5~7 update:
- Fix format error in generated srt file, [#19](https://github.com/SWHL/RapidVideOCR/issues/19)

#### 🎫2023-02-17 v2.0.4 update:
- Optimized processing for incoming `TXTImages` directory. Will be faster and more accurate than passing `RGBImages`. It is recommended to pass in the `TXTImages` directory

#### 💎2023-02-17 v2.0.2 update:
- Fixed the problem of missing spaces in peer subtitle recognition

#### 🎇2023-02-12 v2.0.1 update:
- Fix the bug that the subtitle frame time becomes 0 when the video duration is longer than 1 hour.

#### 🧨2023-01-28 v1.1.9 update:
- Fix the misalignment of the time axis.

#### 👊2023-01-15 v1.1.4 update:
- Add the option to output txt format, currently the v1.1.4 version outputs srt and txt by default.
- Added to adjust the size of the box for selecting subtitles according to the screen size of the running program.

#### 🌈2023-01-10 v1.0.3 update:
- Replace decord with OpenCV because there is a memory leak when decord processes MP4. For details, see [#208](https://github.com/dmlc/decord/issues/208).

#### 🎄2022-12-04 update:
- Add the function of interactively framing the subtitle position, which is enabled by default and is more useful. For details, please refer to the GIF image below. Thanks to @[Johndirr](https://github.com/Johndirr) for the suggestion.
- Optimize the code structure, put RapidOCR related models and configuration files in the `rapidocr` directory
- The configuration file of `rapidvideocr` is also placed in the corresponding directory.

#### ✨2022-06-26 update:
- Parameterized configuration of relevant parameters, including `rapid_ocr` and `rapid_videocr` parts, more flexible

#### 🌼2022-05-08 update:
- Add an interactive operation to determine the threshold value of the binarized subtitle image, only supports Windows system, can be used by `is_select_threshold = True`
- Optimized code

#### 🎉2022-05-03 update:
- Add GPU support, see the specific configuration tutorial: [onnxruntime-gpu version inference configuration](https://github.com/RapidAI/RapidOCR/blob/main/python/onnxruntime_infer/README.md#onnxruntime-gpu%E7%89%88%E6%8E%A8%E7%90%86%E9%85%8D%E7%BD%AE)
- Added support for Japanese, more languages can be supported, see: [List of supported languages](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleOCR/blob/release/2.1/doc/doc_ch/multi_languages.md#%E8%AF%AD%E7%A7%8D%E7%BC%A9%E5%86%99)

#### 💡2022-05-01 update:
- Add the speech recognition module. Since the decoding part of this module can only run on Linux and Mac, if you want to use this module, please use Linux and Mac.
- The current speech recognition code comes from the [RapidASR/python](https://github.com/RapidAI/RapidASR/tree/main/python/base_paddlespeech) section. Model from [PaddleSpeech](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleSpeech/tree/develop/examples/aishell/asr0).
- After a simple test, the voice recognition module is not too accurate. -_-!

#### 2022-03-09 update:
- Add [FAQ](./FAQ.md) module.

#### 2021-12-14 update:
  - [x] Add specific parameter descrition.
  - [x] Make the project logo.
  - [x] Add sample vidoe to run time-consuming benchmark.
